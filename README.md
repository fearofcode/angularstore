Working through the SportsStore tutorial in [_Pro Angular.js_](http://www.apress.com/9781430264484), by Adam Freeman.

I've taken minor liberties with certain style/implementation choices.

I think the code quality in this book is pretty low, and it is not reflective of how I would write production software.

Because I'm using a [different API](https://github.com/fearofcode/pro-angularjs-api-django) than Deployd, this code might not work with it.

If you want the official code for the book, go to the book's [official website](http://www.apress.com/9781430264484).

Also because I'm using a web framework that has built-in admin functionality, I skipped implementing admin stuff.
